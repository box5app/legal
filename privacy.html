                <p>Effective: February 24, 2026</p>
                <p>Last Updated: February 24, 2026</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Box 5 ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
                collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application Box 5 (the "App"). By
                using Box 5, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> Name and basic profile information you provide during
                onboarding, learning preferences and daily goals, and user-generated flashcard content (text and
                images).</p>
            <p><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> We store the content you create within the App, including
                flashcard decks and cards (text and images), study progress and statistics, and learning history.</p>
            <p><strong>AI Feature Content:</strong> When you use the AI Card Generation feature, the content you
                provide — such as text you type, audio recordings, images, or PDF files — is transmitted to our secure
                API for processing. This content is used solely to generate flashcards and is not retained on our
                servers after processing is complete.</p>
            <p><strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong> We use PostHog to automatically collect anonymized
                usage data, including device type and operating system version, app usage statistics, feature
                interactions, and performance data to help us improve the App.</p>
            <p><strong>Purchase and Subscription Data:</strong> When you subscribe to Box 5 Pro, subscription and
                entitlement status is managed by RevenueCat. We receive anonymized purchase data to verify your
                subscription status. We do not store your payment information.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the collected information to provide and maintain the App, store your flashcards and study
                progress locally on your device, track your learning progress using the Leitner spaced repetition
                system, process AI card generation requests, manage your subscription status, improve and optimize the
                App, and respond to your support requests.</p>

            <h2>Data Storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your flashcard data is stored locally on your device using SQLite
                database. This includes your flashcards, decks, study progress, statistics, and learning history. Your
                personal study data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it or use AI features.</p>
            <p><strong>Temporary Cloud Processing:</strong> When you use the AI Card Generation feature, files you
                upload (audio, images, PDFs) are temporarily stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 and automatically
                deleted after processing is complete (typically within minutes). Text input is transmitted directly to
                our API and is not stored.</p>
            <p><strong>No Persistent Cloud Storage:</strong> Box 5 does not require an account and does not
                persistently store your flashcard data on remote servers. All your study-related data remains on your
                device.</p>
            <p><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> Anonymized usage statistics are processed by PostHog to help us
                understand how the App is used and to improve its performance.</p>

            <h2>AI Features and Data Processing</h2>
            <p>Box 5 Pro includes an AI Card Generation feature that creates flashcards from content you provide. Here
                is how your data is handled:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Text</strong> input is sent to OpenAI's API to generate flashcard content. Text is not
                    stored after the request is complete.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio recordings</strong> are uploaded to AWS S3, transcribed by Deepgram's API, and the
                    resulting transcript is sent to OpenAI to generate flashcards. The audio file is deleted from AWS S3
                    after processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Images</strong> are temporarily stored in AWS S3 and sent to OpenAI's vision API for
                    analysis and flashcard generation, then deleted.</li>
                <li><strong>PDF documents</strong> are temporarily stored in AWS S3, processed to extract text, and
                    that text is sent to OpenAI to generate flashcards, then deleted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Do not submit content that is confidential, sensitive, or that you are not permitted to share with
                third-party AI services.</p>

            <h2>Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
            <p>Box 5 Pro is available as a weekly, monthly, or yearly subscription. Purchases are processed by the
                Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</p>
            <p>We use RevenueCat to manage subscription and entitlement status. RevenueCat receives anonymized purchase
                data to verify your subscription. See RevenueCat's Privacy Policy at <a
                    href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">revenuecat.com/privacy</a>.</p>
            <p>We do not store your payment card or billing details. All payment processing is handled by Apple or
                Google.</p>

            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. Your flashcard data is stored
                locally on your device and is not shared. Content you submit for AI processing is sent only to the
                necessary third-party AI providers (OpenAI, Deepgram) to fulfil your request. We share anonymized usage
                analytics with PostHog to help us maintain and improve the App.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>All your flashcard data is stored locally on your device and remains there until you delete the app or
                clear app data. Content submitted for AI processing is deleted from our servers and AWS S3 immediately
                after processing is complete. We do not retain AI-processed content beyond what is needed to fulfil the
                request. Anonymized analytics data is retained by PostHog per their data retention policies.</p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You have the right to:</p>

                    href="mailto:boxfiveapp@gmail.com">boxfiveapp@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Box 5 is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal
                information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided
                us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Local data storage with device-level encryption</li>
                <li>Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS) for all API communications</li>
                <li>Regular security updates</li>
                <li>Temporary-only cloud storage for AI processing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since your flashcard data is stored locally on your device, it benefits from your device's built-in
                security features.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the
                new Privacy Policy in the App and updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the App after
