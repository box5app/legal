            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Box 5 ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
                collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application Box 5 (the "App"). By
                using Box 5, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> Name and basic profile information you provide during
                onboarding, learning preferences and daily goals, and user-generated flashcard content (text and
                images).</p>
            <p><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> We store the content you create within the App, including
                flashcard decks and cards (text and images), study progress and statistics, and learning history.</p>
            <p><strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong> We use PostHog to automatically collect anonymized
                usage data, including device type and operating system version, app usage statistics, feature
                interactions, and performance data to help us improve the App.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the collected information to provide and maintain the App, store your flashcards and study
                progress locally on your device, track your learning progress using the Leitner spaced repetition
                system, improve and optimize the App, and respond to your support requests.</p>

            <h2>Data Storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your flashcard data is stored locally on your device using SQLite
                database. This includes your flashcards, decks, study progress, statistics, and learning history. Your
                personal study data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it.</p>
            <p><strong>No Cloud Storage:</strong> Box 5 does not require an account and does not store your flashcard
                data on remote servers. All your study-related data remains on your device, giving you complete privacy
                and control.</p>
            <p><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> Anonymized usage statistics are processed by PostHog to help us
                understand how the App is used and to improve its performance.</p>

                analytics provider, to help us maintain and improve the App.</p>
